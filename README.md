# Work-Day-Scheduler
## Description
For this task I was assigned with creating a daily schedule where you could save tasks from 9am to 5pm. After saving the tasks, upon refreshing the entered tasks will remain in the text box. Along with this, the schedule is color coded based on whether the time is the past, present, or the future. The current date is also displayed on the top of the website.
